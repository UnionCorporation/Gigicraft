# Overview: What's Gigicraft?
Gigicraft is a scholar-java-based development project. It aims to masterize the LWJGBL library, including OpenGL, OpenAI and OpenSL. The project starts just to prove what the graphical engine can achieve, then develops as a mix between the various features the library offers, and the final goal is to develop a mixed Java-C project that simulates Minecraft. It will take a very long time since I know very little from Java and almost nothing from C, but here I come.
